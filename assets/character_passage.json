    "passage": "The epitome of a perfect student and follower, a diehard practitioner of consistency and a near perfectionist. This son of Kunti is one of the most dynamic characters in Mahabharata. He was loved and adored by Dronacharya, his preceptor, Bhisma, his great-grandfather and above all the Lord himself. And being blessed by these legends clearly meant that victory had to be on his side. For Arjuna there was nothing above his passion, his core competency, his forte archery. He was inward looking. One day while he was having dinner with all his brothers, a gust of wind blew the lamp off. Darkness engulfed the room. Everyone stopped eating as they could see nothing except for Bhima for whom the love for food was above everything else. Unaware of the darkness, he kept eating. The storm passed and Kunti lit the lamp again. By then Bhima had almost completed his dinner. Arjuna was amazed. He asked Bhima the secret of his act. Bhima responded that once you are clear of your target and if your heart, soul, mind and the entire body has been aligned to the target, the target becomes as large as a football and glows to its glory even when there is darkness around. Corporate Arjuna's are execution driven and are not distracted by what's happening around them. An organization has to continually respond to the external environment for which there will be continuous changes. These changes can take various forms, such as realignment of business structures, changes in priorities. But a true Karma yogi is undeterred by these changes. They are aware that execution is critical to success. Without a careful, planned approach to execution, strategic goals cannot be attained. These corporate Arjuna's, therefore, always have a detailed and well-documented goal. For Arjuna, everyone was a teacher in one way or the other. He was adored by Dronacharya because Arjuna was his true disciple in all respects. Whatever Dronacharya taught, he not only practiced and perfected, but would go ahead and try to further evolve the knowledge. Arjuna's thirst for knowledge was so profound that Dronacharya once confessed that he no longer could quench his thirst for knowledge. Corporate Arjuna's too are continuous learners. They make sure they keep themselves updated with the latest. For them, every incident is a learning moment. They continually improvise, innovate and find ways to do things differently and not necessarily different things. The bond of knowledge between the teacher and the disciple had become so strong that Ashwatthama, the son of Dronacharya, too felt insecure and jealous. But this bond also led to two acts for which even the image of this great teacher Dronacharya was tarnished. I will share this when I am discussing Dronacharya. Corporate Arjuna's too have coaches like Dronacharya to closely coach and guide them to excel in their skills. Let me now put forth the bond between Arjuna and the Lord Himself, Krishna. Arjuna, the Karma yogi who did not see or understand anything other than his passion for archery, consciously decided to submit himself at the feet of the Lord. He was aware that he was a specialist in his field, but he also knew that he was ignorant of the other dynamics which prevailed in the manipulative society. Knowledge of which was equally important to survive. Arjuna was very emotional and hence he needed a guide to show him the black, the white and shades of life. Arjuna needed a charioteer, not only to guide his horses in the battle of Kuru Shetra, but also to guide him in the rugged terrain of life. Pleased by the true devotion and submission of Arjuna, the Lord chose him to become the hero of the ultimate battle of righteousness between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. The Lord did not hold his hand, neither did he fight on his behalf, but just helped him realize. He gave his role, his responsibilities, his duty, his karma. He had the perfect mentor in the form of the Lord himself. In the course of the ultimate battle, at one point, Arjuna expressed his concern over the outcome of the battle. At that point, the Lord assured him to focus on his karma or the action and not worry about the result or outcome of his action. For, that was his responsibility. Arjuna never dreamed of becoming a king. He preferred to remain a follower, the partha of the Lord himself. Similarly, even with careful development of an execution plan at business level, execution success is not guaranteed. Even plans at business level fail if they don't receive the corporate support. A host of factors, including politics, inertia and resistance to change, routinely can get in the way of execution success. Hence, corporate Arjuna's too need strong sponsors to ensure their success. The Arjuna's of the corporate world are the ones who strive for professional excellence. Fancy titles or incentives are not their key motivators. It is the work that motivates them. Titles and other recognitions come to them sooner or later as they are superior performers. Just before the great battle of Kurukshetra was about to begin, Lord Krishna took Arjuna's chariot right at the spot from where he could get a clear glimpse of those on the either side. Moment Arjuna saw the same people who he loved and adored dearly his hands trembled and he dropped his weapons and decided not to fight the battle at all. Krishna nothing could be hidden from him. He knew this and that's when Gita was born. But the point is, this incident shows how compassionate and kind hearted Arjuna was. Today in the corporate we need leaders who have a kind heart and are compassionate. Being kind is not weak. It takes courage to be kind. Great personalities who influenced the world like Gautam Buddha, Mahatma Gandhi or Nelson Mandela believed in compassion and forgiveness. Greatest obstacles can be overcome with love and compassion.",

    "character": "Duryodhana",
    "passage": "The eldest son of Dritarastra. Duryodhana, the misguided. Dritarastra, the blind king, the caretaker king, who very well knew that Yudhishthir, eldest of the Pandavas, was the true here to the throne of kingdom of Hastinapur. In spite of which, he fed his son Duryodhana with the regular dose of a false dream that he would grow up to beur the crown. This misplaced aspiration was further ignited by his evil uncle Shakuni. Duryodhana was an instrument for Dritarastra to attain what he could not achieve. Duryodhana grew up with the feeling of sheer jealousy. If provided with the right guidance, he could become an asset and a strong pillar of the vast kingdom of Hastinapur. He too was one of the best students of Dhronacharya in the art of warfare. Unfortunately, right from the childhood, he just got the evil company of Shakuni, his uncle. There was no one to discipline him. His father, blinded by his son's love, always shielded his wrongdoings and his mother Gandhari, also did little as she blinded herself with a blindfold of faithfulness towards her husband. From his early days, Duryodhana got what he demanded. He never got no for an answer. The word share was just absent in his dictionary. He had 99 brothers, but because of his short-sightedness, jealousy and an evil mind led all of them to the gallows of death. Duryodhana was filled with so much arrogance that he could earn the love of no one. He was fearless and steadfast. If guided well, could have become a strong general if not the leader. He was a very poor listener, which in turn made him a poor communicator. He was a fool who believed he alone was enough to win the battle. He had best of generals in the form of Bhisma and Dhronacharya. He got their physical support, but never their blessings. The Lord Himself, before the battle of Kurukshetra, put forth the option, both to Arjuna as well to Duryodhana, to choose between him with a condition he would not pick up any weapon during the war, or his ocean-sized army. Duryodhana immediately jumped and chose the ocean-sized army while Arjuna chose the Lord. Duryodhana blinded by arrogance and slave to the worldly materials, only saw the visible size of the army. On the other hand, Arjuna, who preferred to submit himself to the Lord, chose him, as he very well knew that the Lord, even if he doesn't pick up weapon, was equivalent to an ocean of soldiers. Why are we discussing Duryodhana if he is nothing but an idol of negatives? The reason is, in every one of us there is the Duryodhana. Hence it is very important for us to realize that, and then make every attempt to purge it out completely. He could see nothing and nobody beyond himself. Duryodhana was just filled with himself. He believed in no one. He had no trust in anyone and was filled with envy. He was envious of Bhima right from his childhood. And then we had engulfed him to the extent that he even poisoned Bhima and threw him in a pond which was inhabited by poisonous snakes. But as it is said that Lord is always by the side of goodness. Moment Bhima was bit by snakes, their poison only acted as antidote, and thus Bhima not only gained consciousness but also gained the strength of a hundred elephants. Envy blinds a person. One who is filled with envy never counts his blessings. He spends his life comparing himself with others. His only aspiration lies in grabbing what belongs to others. He thinks happiness lies in snatching. But in the process he just gets more frustrated and frustration leads to sorrow. Anger then seeps in. Moment one is blinded by anger. He sees this to see difference between good and bad. Duryodhana was offered a part of the kingdom, but envy, greed and anger made him devoid of all logic and good sense. He turned down the offer and announced that he would not part with his land even the size of a needle. The fool did not realize that by turning down the offer he had turned down the offer to live and extended his invitation to a costly end which no human being would even think of. Though he was strong physically but all his vices made him fragile as a glass. His arrogance and pride led him to have faith in no one, not even his few well-wishers. Because of this he was left alone. When Duryodhana was nearing defeat at the hands of the Pandavas, Gandhari, his mother, who because of her immense devotion to the Lord had some divine powers, asked him to take bath and come to her in the same state as he was born naked. She wanted to remove her blindfold for that moment and wanted to lay the rays that would emanate from her eyes and form an armor around her son that no weapon could penetrate. When Krishna heard about this he became concerned. But he also knew that Duryodhana's mind could be very easily manipulated. When Duryodhana, as instructed by his mother after taking the holy dip, was about to enter the tent where his mother was, Krishna came and mocked at Duryodhana for entering naked before his mother. During this Duryodhana immediately wrapped a big banana leaf around his waist. Moment Gandhari removed the blind, all positive rays emerged and formed a cover around all the exposed part other than the part that Duryodhana had covered with the leaf. That area remained vulnerable which also became the cause of his death. So how can we spot the Duryodhana in the corporates? You will see that they are highly egoists and can't think beyond themselves. They will not listen to others and do only what they think is right. They are disrespectful towards everyone around them. They can humiliate and insult others without slightest of consideration. Their only interest lies in self-interest. Duryodhana's of the corporates are highly manipulative. They indulge in bad politics and are ruthless. These executives are capable but will cause more damage to the organization and its reputation. They believe in achieving ends through all unethical means. They may have high IQ but are miserable in their EQ. Because of absence of EQ or the emotional quotient they will have troubled relationships both at work and personal front. That frustration will show in their work. They are highly suspicious and trust deficit. They believe only in snatching from others but don't believe in sharing. Environment around them always is highly vicious and negative.",

  "character": "Dronacharya",
  "passage": "What a chariator is to the horses. A preceptor is to a disciple. A chariator is bound to his horses through a reen, while a preceptor is bound to his disciple through the medium of knowledge. In other words, to help the horses or the disciples reach their goals, it is the chariator, the preceptor who plays the key role. Dronacharya's of the corporates too are committed to people development. These employees are great coaches. These talents need to be identified and nurtured as they through their natural skills to develop people can help create a robust talent pipeline for the organization. Dronacharya, the preceptor, knew how to get the best out from his disciples. He was one preceptor who not just preached but also believed in action. In fact, in the final exam, I mean the battle of the Kurukshetra that not only was the prowess of his disciples was put to test but also his. He chose just not to be mute observer while his disciples appeared for the ultimate exam, but even he plunged into the fray with equal zest and commitment. He was a true assessor of the strengths of his disciples. First, he put his disciples through all faculties and then assigned them the discipline where he knew that they would excel. That's why, while he recommended Bo and Arrow for Arjuna, he recommended Mace for Bhima and Duryodhana, spear for Yudhishthir and sword for Nakhil and Sahadev. Incorporates the talents with coaching skills like Dronacharya walk the talk. They are great performers themselves, continually honing their skills and at the same time always ready to help those who are seeking guidance. They are good at scouting talents themselves. Hence, incorporates such talents need to be actively engaged in hiring activities and coaching talents. Dronacharya was a passionate teacher for whom his role was much above his role as a husband or even a father for that matter. He didn't mind being accused of bias by his own son, Nashvathama. His mission was not just to train, but train power excellence. He committed to Arjuna that he would make him the best archer of his time and he lived up to his commitment. To accomplish what he had promised to his disciple, he did not think twice before committing the shameful act of asking for a Kalavya's thumb in the form of Guru Daksina. This act of his tarnished his image in the pages of this epic, but he did not care. He was a disciplinarian, but at the same time showed a lot of affection and concern towards the well-being of his disciples. His love, especially for Arjuna, was incomparable. While Arjuna kept acquiring the learnings at a stallion's pace, Dronacharya too kept sharing all the knowledge he had at the same pace without withholding anything back. In fact, it reached a point where he submitted to Arjuna that he had nothing more to offer to him in the form of knowledge. Such was his humility. The corporate coaches too, once they see the hunger in the budding talents, go ahead and share all relevant knowledge. Coaches can also be identified amongst the aging employee, high performing employees, so when the employee leaves or retires, the knowledge does not go down the drain. He is trusted, as a coach, they generally pass on the knowledge. Dronacharya assessed his disciples, not just on the skill front, but also on their adherence to values, principles and above all compassion. He never wanted his knowledge to reach wrong hands. This while he was taking bath in the river, through his skills to create illusion, he created a crocodile. The crocodile seemed to approach him with his open jaws. Seeing this sight, while all other disciples just stood mum and pray for his safety, Arjuna without thinking for a moment, plunged in the waters to try and save his teacher. Dronacharya was convinced that Arjuna would always raise his weapon for the rightists. In the corporate world too, good coaches ensure values are core to effective performance. These corporate Dronacharya's, like the examples shared above, put their prodigies through different situations in order to assess their response and then guide them to what is right or wrong. These corporate Dronacharya's have good fan following and loyal followers because of their profound knowledge and mastery over subjects. Corporates need to recognize, nurture and retain these coaching talents as they create high value for the organization. They are very loyal to their job and are great contributors to effective employee engagement strategies in turn leading to high employee retention.",

  "passage": "For non-believers of the terms of luck and destiny, the story of Karna which surely make him re-evaluate their belief. Everything seemed to be against the sun of Kunti. He was born to a princess but was raised by a charioteer deprived of all luxuries. Dronacharya did not accept him as a disciple for the simple reason that he was not from a royal lineage. He had to face humiliation at the hands of his own Pandava brothers time and again. He was trained by the great Parshuram but for no fault of his, invited the wrath of his teacher and was cursed that during most crucial phase, when he would be in dire need of his knowledge, the knowledge will fail him. In spite of all external factors working against him, he did not lose focus and mastered his art of archery to perfection. If Arjuna was worried about anyone, it was KARNA. As it was only KARNA who had the potential to surpass him in his skill of archery. Arjuna did not get anything from the world but that did not stop him from giving to the society. Stories of his generosity would humble anyone. Rightfully he was bestowed the title of Danveer Karna or the generous Karna, a title that no other king could earn. He had a reputation that right at the beginning of his day, if anyone approached him for a favour, he would fulfil that at any cost. During the decisive moment of Kurukshetra war with the Pandavas, Lord Indra decided to exploit this opportunity. He approached Karna as a poor sage just when he was about to begin his day and requested him for his golden armour. Karna was born with the golden armour and it was a part of his body. It was a blessing to him that no weapon would harm him till he had his armour on. Karna was well aware of this and also knew that it was Lord Indra himself in disguise. Still, he went ahead and handed over his armour. He in true sense was a principal centred leader. He stuck to his principles even when he had the option to choose not to. He was loyal to the core. Even when his mother Kunti revealed to him his true identity and the fact that he was the eldest of the Pandavas, he chose to continue to stay on the side of Duryodhana. He chose to stay and fight for Duryodhana well aware that Kauravas were heading towards a sheer defeat at the hands of Pandavas. So, who are these corporate Karna's? Corporate Karna's are the ones who strive, breathe and live for their profession and their organization. However, they fail to market themselves adequately. Because of this, leaders at the top always fail to spot them. But these Karna's are not bothered by it. For them, the sole motivation is their principles and their work. It is the duty of the leaders to identify such Karna's and give them their due. Leaders can be completely assured of huge dividends on this investment that they make on the Karna's of the corporate today.",

  "passage": "While so far, I have talked about diverse personalities, my book will be incomplete if I don't weave in the diversity of gender too. One strong character who had immensely important role in Mahabharata is Draupadi, wife of Pandavas. This also shows how progressive this epic of Mahabharata is that recognized the importance of gender diversity during those days. Another strong reason why readers as you who want to make it big must take some time out to read and understand the great Mahabharata, the ultimate epic. Draupadi was the daughter of King Drupada. The birth of Draupadi happened from the sacrificial fire of Putra Mishthi Yagna, because of which she was very theory and outspoken. Draupadi asked for five qualities in her husband as boon from Lord Shiva for her penance. The first quality that he would be a moral man. Second, he should be strong. Third, he should be good looking. Fourth, he should be a great warrior. And fifth, that he should be kind and loving. Lord Shiva blessed her that she will have five husbands as it's not possible for one man to have all these qualities. That's how she got married to the five brothers Pandavas. This is a great lesson for those who want it all. The expectation in itself is unnatural and unrealistic. We have to choose wisely what we wish for. If you aspire to rise high and rise fast in your organization, you need to be prepared to make big sacrifices. You cannot have the best of everything. When you fail to acknowledge this fact, you experience negative stress and frustration. When Duryodhana humiliated and insulted Draupadi in front of all elders in the court, she took a vow that day to not tie her hair till Duryodhana was taught a lesson. This episode shows her strength and determination of not giving up easily to circumstances. In the corporates too, women employees as you should be assertive and confident. You should have the self-belief. In organizations especially in India, we see that promising women talents leave their jobs when faced with family situations. This must change. We have to create an ecosystem for women talents to survive and thrive in organizations. Families have to play a big role here. There is also a feeling amongst women talents that they need to possess manlike qualities to succeed in organizations. This is absolutely misplaced. Why would organizations hire women talent if the requirement is for qualities of a man? Women bring immense value to organizations by being themselves. Draupadi had a great friend and guide in Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna always responded whenever she seeked his intervention. In corporates too, if you are a woman and want to make it big, make sure you have a strong and senior mentor who can guide you and help you to eliminate blockages in your progress.",

  "character": "Krishna",
  "passage": "At the beginning of my book, I mentioned about a character who I referred to as the Sampur napurush. So time to remove the wheel from the secret. Yes, the Sampur napurush is none other than the great Lord Krishna. The divine Krishna cannot be confined in words, but without him this book is meaningless. Krishna's childhood starting from his birth was filled with hardships. His parents, Devaki and Vasudev, even though were from royal families, were put in prison by Krishna's own maternal uncle. He was born in prison and subsequently separated from his parents. This was not the end of troubles, but on the contrary his life was tuned with hardships. Every time he overcame one obstacle, there was an even bigger challenge staring at him. But he faced every challenge with his divine smile. Never ever think that leaders are born with a silver spoon. Krishna's of the corporates too are also smiling in the face of any adversity, however big it may be. Just by their smile they have the capability to dilute the challenge. With every challenge that they overcome their glitter becomes much brighter. Krishna challenged the status quo right from his childhood days. While villagers used to worship the God of rain Indra, Krishna challenged that. His argument was, it was the Govardhana hill that provided grass to the cows, land and shelter to live everything that the villagers needed. So he convinced all to worship Govardhana instead. Indra became furious and started pouring inciscent rain. Lord Krishna calmly took all villagers along with him to the Govardhana hill and lifted the hill on the tip of his little finger. All villagers took shelter under the hill. Indra got all exhausted pouring rain but no villager was affected. Indra finally gave up. Lord Krishna actually did all this to destroy Indra's ego. Because of the corporate world are bold and fearless to ask tough questions. They do what is right for the organization. At the same time they care for people and make sure they are protected. There is nothing more important than righteousness for corporate Krishna's. The great battle of Guru Kshetra was all about establishing righteousness. Krishna did not pick up a weapon in his battle but still was the hero. This was all because of his mastery in influencing skills. Guru Kshetra was a battle between members of the same family. Arjuna, hence, was hesitant to the core and ready to give up everything but not fight against those who were his own. Krishna influenced him. That conversation took the form of the Gita. The content of which is relevant even today for people from all walks of life. Krishna himself did not undertake much formal education but ended up enlightening Arjuna and the whole mankind through the holy Gita. Krishna's of the corporate like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs who were college dropouts but because of their wisdom are considered icons for the corporate worldwide. So just textbook knowledge in isolation means nothing. It is only when knowledge takes the form of action transcends into wisdom. These corporate Krishna's are an organization's high potentials and need to be put on accelerated growth track. These talents love challenges in all shapes and forms. They are very agile and exhibit great people leader qualities. Like Lord Krishna who was prompt to step out of his comfort zone in order to take on challenges and create a new world order of righteousness moving from Vrindavan to Mathura to Dwarka. Even corporate Krishna's are very mobile and are willing to move to any corner of the world to make big of their career.",
